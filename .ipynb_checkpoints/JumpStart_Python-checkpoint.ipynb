    "## Some closing remarks\n",
    "Learning to programming is best done through doing. Here, I have given a minor taste of some of the things we will be discussing in later notebooks. The absolute best resource you can use is Google. Many answer can be found by simply searching _this thing I want to do_ + python and copying the style found in that search result. Do not be afraid to try new things! Run a code, watch it fail, then try again! Google the error and learn about what might have gone wrong! Learning to code is like lifting weights: the pain of learning the \"right\" way to do it is the best educational tool available."
